A TV Show look up and selection application.

Upon navigating to the website, you will be able to browse a large library of tv shows (past and present)
Upon submitting a search, each result will have an option for you to add to your "watch list'
From here you will be able to click on the link from the show and be taken to another webpage which will
display a summary of the series, as well as information and summaries for each episode of the first season
of that show.
If you decide you no longer wish to have a show on your 'watch list' search for that show and uncheck the 
'add to my watchlist' box
